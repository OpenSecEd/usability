\emph{Summary:}
One important aspect of security, which technical people tend to forget, is the 
users' weaknesses.
The psychology of the human mind is therefore an important subject to discuss 
in the context of security.
And consequently, we must adapt our systems to those limitations.
In this learning session, we will focus on relevant parts of our psychology.

\emph{Intended learning outcomes:}
After this learning session you should be able:
\begin{itemize}
  \item to \emph{incorporate} basic psychology in the design of a system to 
    increase its security.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Reading:}
\Citeauthor{Anderson2008sea} gives a short summary of the psychology of users, 
their strengths and weaknesses, in Chapter 2 \enquote{Usability and Psychology} 
of \citetitle{Anderson2008sea}~\cite{Anderson2008sea}.
