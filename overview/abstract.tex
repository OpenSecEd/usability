One important aspect of security, which traditionally is forgotten, is the 
users' weaknesses.
The psychology of the human mind is therefore an important subject to discuss 
in the context of security.
And consequently, we must adapt our systems to those limitations.
How the users function and how to adapt systems to their limitations is at the 
centre of the usability area.

Anderson gives a short summary of the psychology of users, their strengths and 
weaknesses, in Chapter 2 ``Usability and Psychology'' in 
\cite{Anderson2008sea}.
Also treated here is the ever-recurring problem of password policies.
The material covering this area is the article 
\citetitle{Komanduri2011opa}~\cite{Komanduri2011opa} and its follow-up article 
\citetitle{Komanduri2014can}~\cite{Komanduri2014can}.
