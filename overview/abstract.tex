One thing which is usually forgotten by engineers, is how the users' actually 
functions.
It is therefore important to understand the basic psychology of the human mind,
and it is especially important in the context of security.
Consequently, we must adapt our systems to those limitations.
How the users function and how to adapt systems to their limitations is at the 
centre of the usability area.

More specifically, after this session you should be able to
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{understand and apply} basic usability methodology to 
    \emph{design} secure and usable systems.
  \item \emph{evaluate} the usability of security and privacy solutions and 
    \emph{suggest} improvements for both usability and security.
\end{itemize}

Anderson gives a short summary of the psychology of users, their strengths and 
weaknesses, in Chapter 2 \enquote{Usability and Psychology} in 
\cite{Anderson2008sea}.
We also give and overview of what is treated in Chapters 3, 4, 6, 12, 13, 32, 
34 in \citetitle{SecurityAndUsability}~\cite{SecurityAndUsability}.
